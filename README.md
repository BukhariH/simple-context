# Simple Context

This application serves as a *teaching tool* to demystify Java Annotations & Spring to interns & developers who come from a non-Java background.

The usual split I follow:

- *40 mins* - Pair program to re-create this app from scratch
    - Explain Inversion of Control principle
    - Explain Singleton design pattern
    - Explain different ways of autowiring beans
    - Explain different types of Stereotypes e.g. @Component vs @Service
- *20 mins* - Discussing additional topics such as:
    - Contrast our implementation vs Spring Context's implementation 
    - Explain & discuss Dependency Cycles
    - Implement Spring Web Annotations
    - Discuss Spring configuration
    - Discuss implementing whatever the developer is interested in

I've found that spending an hour working with a new developer on this allows them to feel more comfortable with Java & Spring instantaneously.
